## About

You are a lost person, in a dark forest, where you are not welcome. You are looking to get back to your car, but the forest is a real maze. You will have to run, hide and avoid the roots on the ground, because some trees will not like that.

### Controls

- `WASD`: Move
- `Shift`: Sprint
- `Space`: Jump
- `ESC`: Settings

And support Gamepad.
